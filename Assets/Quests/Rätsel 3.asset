  - 'What did you say little human? You want to have the old sailors seacharts? No
    can do! But I can help you along your journey...the pirates of {Place(Shipwreck
    Stinger)} told me they hunted a ship with an old couple a few weeks back! There''s
    an old Legend on how you can get to {Place(Shipwreck Stinger)} from here! If
    you can make it, they''ll surely help you!


    A suitor chased after {Starsign(Jungfrau)}.
    He was a real creep about it and didn''t leave them alone, though they denied
    him! He followed them {Time(night and day)}, and they ran from him straight ahead.
    At last when they reached  {Place(Red Bay)} the fleeing {Starsign(Jungfrau) noticed
    the mighty {Starsign(Skorpion)} in the sky and bet their fate on the protection
    of that poisonous beast! And fateful it was, as the suitor crashed at {Place(Shipwreck
    Stinger)} and they were finally free.'
