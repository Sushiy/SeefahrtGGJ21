  - "Dear Descendant,\n\nif you read this letter, that means through chance or fate,
    it has found it's way far enough northward to reach you. \nAs you know, we have
    gone on a journey to uncharted islands. But our journey came to an abrupt end,
    when our ship capsized in a storm. Luckily we were swept onto a small island
    called {Place(Isle Mystico)}. There is not much here, but a large birdstatue
    that overlooks a hill and our wrecked ship. \n\nPerhaps you could send help?
    Try asking the old sailor at the foot of {Place(Snow Peak)}. You can follow the
    {Starsign(Sch\xFCtze)} {Himmelsrichtung} to reach it.\n\nBest Regards,\nNanna
    and Granda!"
