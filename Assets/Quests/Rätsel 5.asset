  - 'Ohh a visitarrr! Aye we''ve seen the daring old couple! Let me tell ya the storry
    of how it went down, arrr!

    We''d been out on plunder and were just returning
    to this ''ere beautiful island! So..we arrrrived at {Place(Shipwreck Stinger)}
    from the north, aye? When suddenly Bobby here called out! {RawDirection(At 9
    o'' clock)} he''d spotted your grandda''s ship and we decided to follow them
    for  even more booty! {Time(Two days)} we tailed them that way, aye? We thtought
    we''d catch them for sure!

    Then - suddenly they did a sharp {RawDirection(clock-wise
    quarter turn)} after passing through some {Place(nasty Rocks)}. Surprised, we
    retreated. However, we could already see a big storm coming up, so they could''t
    have gotten far.


    Well there ya have it little one!

    Good Luck, aye?!'
